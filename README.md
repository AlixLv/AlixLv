## üß≠ Professional background
Formerly a customer service representative and store manager, I'm retraining at Ada Tech School in backend development. After actively participating in sales strategy and building trusting relationships with customers at my previous employers, I now want to put my skills to work to improve product quality.

Alongside my professional career, I have been self-training in web development by taking online courses. With Ada Tech School, I took the plunge and became a web developer, putting my skills to work for my future company!

**I‚Äôm currently looking for an apprenticeship starting from June 2025 to perfect my skills.**


Ada Tech School is a school whose pedagogy is based on autonomy and collaboration. The programme is structured in two parts: one part is devoted to learning the fundamentals of programming while doing peer-programming. A second time to carry out collective projects, using the agile method. These two periods are rotated every fortnight. 

## üíª What I love about programming

Being close to a project, from conceptualisation to delivery, being able to test different approaches and discover new technologies are all elements that motivate me in my career change.
**As a strong team player with an inquisitive mind, I enjoy peer-programming, exchanging ideas and learning from my peers.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack
**JavaScript, Python, Django, SQL, TailwindCSS, HTML5, CSS3**

## üå± Hobbies
I love cooking, trying new recipes and sharing meals with friends and family. I've also had a strain of sourdough for over 2 years, which I use to adapt recipes for cakes and cookies.

Reading novels and essays and listening to podcasts fuel my curiosity on a daily basis!
