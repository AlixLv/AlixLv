## üß≠ Professional background
I started my career at ARTE France as a web editor and production manager. Thanks to the various projects I've worked on, I've been able to strengthen my communication and project management skills.
Then, wanting to get closer to the final customer and the product, I changed jobs and became a cheesemonger at Terroirs d'Avenir. The team spirit required for this job and my desire to respond as effectively as possible to customer requests carried me through this experience.
My previous experience before Ada, as an account manager at Kube, led me to work hand-in-hand with developers to improve the user experience and convert visitors into subscribers. 

Alongside my professional career, I have been self-training in web development by taking online courses. With Ada Tech School, I took the plunge and became a web developer, putting my skills to work for my future company!

**I‚Äôm currently looking for an apprenticeship starting from February 2025 to perfect my skills.**


Ada Tech School is a school whose pedagogy is based on autonomy and collaboration. The programme is structured in two parts: one part is devoted to learning the fundamentals of programming while doing peer-programming. A second time to carry out collective projects, using the agile method. These two periods are rotated every fortnight. 

## üíª What I love about programming

Being close to a project, from conceptualisation to delivery, being able to test different approaches and discover new technologies are all elements that motivate me in my career change.
**As a strong team player with an inquisitive mind, I enjoy peer-programming, exchanging ideas and learning from my peers.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack
**JavaScript, Python, Django, SQL, HTML, CSS**

## üå± Hobbies
I love cooking, trying new recipes and sharing meals with friends and family. I've also had a strain of sourdough for over 2 years, which I use to adapt recipes for cakes and cookies.

Reading novels and essays and listening to podcasts fuel my curiosity on a daily basis!
