## üß≠ Professional background
I previously worked at ARTE France, where my main missions were to provide editorial recommandations and best practices to our external partners. Thanks to this experience, I strengthened my communication and project management skills.
Then, wanting to get closer to the final customer and the product, I changed jobs and became a cheesemonger at Terroirs d'Avenir. The team spirit required for this job and my desire to respond as effectively as possible to customer requests carried me through this experience.
Finally, I worked at Kube, as a customer relations-manager. This position enabled me to strengthen my skills in identifying customer needs and translating them for the business teams. It also led me to work hand-in-hand with developers to improve the user experience and convert visitors into subscribers. 

Alongside my professional career, I have been self-training in web development by taking online courses. With Ada Tech School, I took the plunge and became a web developer, putting my skills to work for my future company!

**I‚Äôm currently looking for an apprenticeship starting from April/Mai 2025 to perfect my skills.**


Ada Tech School is a school whose pedagogy is based on autonomy and collaboration. The programme is structured in two parts: one part is devoted to learning the fundamentals of programming while doing peer-programming. A second time to carry out collective projects, using the agile method. These two periods are rotated every fortnight. 

## üíª What I love about programming

Being close to a project, from conceptualisation to delivery, being able to test different approaches and discover new technologies are all elements that motivate me in my career change.
**As a strong team player with an inquisitive mind, I enjoy peer-programming, exchanging ideas and learning from my peers.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack
**JavaScript, Python, Django, SQL, TailwindCSS, HTML5, CSS3**

## üå± Hobbies
I love cooking, trying new recipes and sharing meals with friends and family. I've also had a strain of sourdough for over 2 years, which I use to adapt recipes for cakes and cookies.

Reading novels and essays and listening to podcasts fuel my curiosity on a daily basis!
